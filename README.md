This is my review for the 1979 science fiction thriller, **Alien**. 
The Ridley Scott film is exciting and thrilling but most certainly dated. 
Although, it is most certainly a groundbreaking film that not only broke boundaries in the genre but also opened gates for many futures films. 
The outdated special effects and prothetics definitely effect a younger viewer's opinion. 
However, there are many highlights all viewers can enjoy.
With a strong female lead in Ripley and a persistent foe. The flow of the movie is not only enjoyable, but well paced. 
I rate this movie a 8/10.
