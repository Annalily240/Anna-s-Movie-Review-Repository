It Ends With Us is a phemoninal new 2024 film staring Blake Lively and Justin Balndoni.
As a great film that that discusses diffcult topics such as sexual and physical abuse, it had few shortcomings.
The costumes and actors both fit hte books well and the pacing was slow but steady.
However, the outside drama and the news has taken away some of the special qualities of the movie. Such as the the unity such heavy topics deserve. 
I rate this movie a 9/10.
